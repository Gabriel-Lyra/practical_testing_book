    "Continuous Integration\n",
    "================\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuous Integration (CI), is a software development technique where all developers send their code to a central repository. There it passes through a process of build and testing. It's objectives are find and investigate bugs quicker and therefore enhance code quality and also diminishing the time it takes to validate and release new features. "

    "## Why is it necessary?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before, developers teams could work separately for longs periods of time and then join their code to the master branch when they're done. Many problems may occur this way and many bugs where accumulated and kept there for a long time. This practice made difficult to distribute the code fast to clients. This is where Continuous Integration comes into action. "

    "## How does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, developers use a version control system, such as git. Before submitted their code to code repositories such as GitHub, Bitbucket or GitLab, for example. A CI server is integrated with these code buckets in order to run the tests automatically, alongside with building the system, and may display errors right away. \n",
    "This way, the code changes are created, tested and prepared automatically, so that the production are facilitated. "
