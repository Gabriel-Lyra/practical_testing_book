    "Continuous Integration (CI), is a software development technique where all developers send their code to a central repository. There it passes through a process of build and testing. It's objectives are find and investigate bugs quicker and therefore enhance code quality and also diminishing the time it takes to validate and release new features.\n"

    "\n",
    "Normally, developers use a version control system, such as git. After submitting their code to shared repositories a CI server automatically run tests, alongside with building the system, and may display errors right away. As changes that are made are typically small, pinpointing the specific change that caused a defect can be spotted and corrected quickly.\n",
